An online app which generates a musical rhythm to help with sight-reading practice.

Written using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The rhtyhm displayed on screen when the New Rhythm button is clicked is generated at random. The buttons at the bottom of the screen can be used to change the 
time signature, include or exclude particular rhythm values and change the number of bars that will be displayed.

I previously wrote this app using JavaFX but have recreated it as a javascript based web app to be more useful and accessible. I will be continually adding to 
the functionality of the app and I am reusing the java code I wrote to make an android app version.
